## PhD

After graduating in Aerospace Engineering in Italy, I spent four years in
Stockholm where I obtained my PhD at the [Linn√© FLOW
Centre](https://www.flow.kth.se) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
My [PhD thesis](/assets/pdfs/JacopoCanton_PhDthesis.pdf), which was awarded the
GKN aerospace award in mechanics, focused on two main subjects: the numerical
study of transitional and turbulent flow in bent pipes, and the search for a
viable drag reduction mechanism in fully turbulent flows.

During this time I published eight journal articles and participated as a
speaker in sixteen international conferences.
I was also invited as a visiting researcher at Argonne National Laboratories,
collaborated with the R&D group of Tetra Pak, co-supervised three Masters
theses, and was teaching assistant for the CFD course for three years.

You can [download my PhD thesis](/assets/pdfs/JacopoCanton_PhDthesis.pdf), and
view my publications on my [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ypmj8YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
profile.

## CSElab

The [CSElab](https://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich hosted my first
post-doc with an [ETHZ
fellowship](https://ethz.ch/en/research/research-promotion/eth-fellowships.html).
During this time I developed a machine learning model to improve CFD
simulations on coarse grids.

## IAC

I am currently doing a post-doc at ETH Zurich at the [Institute for Atmospheric
and Climate Science](https://iac.ethz.ch/group/climate-and-water-cycle.html).
My focus is on improving the modelling of clouds and the water cycle by
developing new parametrisations for subgrid-scale mechanisms.
