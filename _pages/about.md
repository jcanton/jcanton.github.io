Hi! I am Jacopo Canton.

I am a detail oriented researcher with a passion for complex physics
simulations, nonlinear chaotic systems, and machine learning.
I am a tinkerer, coder, hobbyist photographer, running and cycling enthusiast.

I love learning and solving stimulating problems involving physics and
mechanics.
I graduated as an Aerospace engineer in Milan, obtained a PhD in fluid
mechanics in Stockholm, and I am currently working as a post-doc in weather and
climate in Zurich.

In my spare time I love fixing and riding bicycles, running in the woods
surrounding Zurich, reading books, bouldering, working on small github
projects, and spending time with my friends.

If you are interested, you can [download my CV](/assets/pdfs/JacopoCanton_CV.pdf).
