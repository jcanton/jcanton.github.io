Hi! I am Jacopo Canton.

I am a detail oriented scientist with a passion for complex physics
simulations, nonlinear chaotic systems, and programming.
I love tinkering with machines, wood working, and coding; I am a hobbyist
photographer, and a running and cycling enthusiast.

I love learning and solving stimulating problems involving physics and
mechanics.
I graduated as an Aerospace engineer in Milan, obtained a PhD in fluid
mechanics at KTH in Stockholm, and I am currently working as a post-doc in
weather and climate science at ETH Zurich.

In my spare time I love fixing and riding bicycles, running in the woods
surrounding Zurich, reading books, bouldering, working on cool github projects,
and spending time with my friends.

If you are interested, you can [download my CV](/assets/pdfs/JacopoCanton_CV.pdf).
