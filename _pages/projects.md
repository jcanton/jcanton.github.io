## Automated maps

As for 2020, with lockdowns extending into 2021, my girlfriend and I have
substituted our commute to the office with walks around the city.
To make things more interesting, and help varying our routes, I wrote some
Python code to automatically generate a map of our walks.
You can [access the interactive map](/maps/) directly on this website, while
the code to generate it is freely accessible on my [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/jcanton/garminMaps).

## eX-Mech

[eX-Mech](https://github.com/eX-Mech) is a GitHub organization I created with
[Nicol√≤ Fabbiane](https://github.com/nfabbiane/), a fellow PhD student, during
my time at KTH in Stockholm.
It hosts a collection of open source projects ranging from LaTeX classes, to
mesh generation software, to [pymech](https://pymech.readthedocs.io): our
Python suite for handling mesh and data fields of CFD codes.
